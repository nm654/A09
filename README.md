# A09
The Town Hall Speaker Project
<p> After the complications of A08 I finally figured out how to update everything again!</p>
<p> Using the Add from VCS dialog when there's no files open I ported in the link of the repository from github</p>
<p> From there, the only thing I have to actually do to add everything is make sure it's in the repository folder!</p>
  <p> That's a relief. I thought I'd never figure that out...</p>
